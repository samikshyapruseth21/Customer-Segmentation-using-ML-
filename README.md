## Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning
- This project employs unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing transaction-level data, the goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enhance targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.


📁 Project Structure
Files/: Contains the input dataset provided by the retailer.

Customer_Segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook detailing the data analysis, preprocessing, and clustering processes.


🧠 Methodology
Data Exploration: Initial analysis to understand data distribution, identify missing values, and detect outliers.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features to prepare for clustering.

Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features that contribute significantly to customer segmentation.

Clustering: Applying K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on purchasing patterns.

Evaluation: Assessing the quality of clusters using metrics like the Silhouette Score and visualizations.
