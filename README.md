## Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning
- This project employs unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Analyzing transaction-level data aims to identify distinct customer groups to enhance targeted marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.


- 📁 Project Structure
Files/: Contains the input dataset provided by the retailer.
Customer_Segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook detailing the data analysis, preprocessing, and clustering processes.

- 🧠 Methodology
Data Exploration: Initial analysis to understand data distribution, identify missing values, and detect outliers.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features to prepare for clustering.

Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features that contribute significantly to customer segmentation.

Clustering: Applying the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers based on purchasing patterns.

Evaluation: Assessing the quality of clusters using metrics like the Silhouette Score and visualizations.

- 📊 Results
The clustering process revealed distinct customer segments, each exhibiting unique purchasing behaviors. These insights can assist the retailer in tailoring marketing campaigns and improving customer satisfaction.
